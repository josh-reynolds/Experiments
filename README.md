# Experiments

Short code snippets - inspired by other projects, explorations of algorithms or language features, or whatever. Anything that grows too large will probably be moved to its own repo, but this is a good place to stash ideas and mostly-working but incomplete ideas.

I just stumbled across [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) - working on the exercises here, but this is a good candidate for its own repro.

The Traveller project is also growing quickly. Another candidate to move out...
