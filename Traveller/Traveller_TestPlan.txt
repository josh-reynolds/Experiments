Testing Traveller app

Need more automated tests, and probably a more robust framework. Currently
have a very simple hand-rolled test class with just three tests in it.

Uncertain what will play nice with Processing. Needs exploration; but also
consider migrating the whole thing to plain Java (in which case we'd need 
to re-implement all the graphics stuff and other library support). But we 
then take advantage of JUnit, Cucumber, etc. as well as get away from the
limitations of the hidden inner classes.

We can do manual spot-checking for now (sketch below), but given the volume
of output this will probably only catch egregious errors.

Most basic - runs without exceptions.
Second level - screen/console output passes visual inspection
Third level - data files (3) written to disk pass inspection

In addition to automated tests, could write some parser/scanners that 
do the equivalent separate from the app itself.

Scenarios:
Two modes times two schemes times three rulesets = 12 scenarios

Rules	Scheme		Mode
------------------------------
CT77	Default		New
CT77	Default		Load
CT77	Print-friendly	New
CT77	Print-friendly	Load

CT81	Default		New
CT81	Default		Load
CT81	Print-friendly	New
CT81	Print-friendly	Load

Scouts	Default		New
Scouts	Default		Load
Scouts	Print-friendly	New
Scouts	Print-friendly	Load

I've overhauled the TestSuite class since writing the notes above. Still
a bit primitive, but a test harness structure is emerging. Mimicking
JUnit, at least my memory of it. Authoring new tests is fairly simple
with minimal boilerplate - repeated/common code is factored out.

Still exploring the 'runner' space. As we apply to different classes, the
ways a test is invoked (and what kind of entities it expects) changes.
Most notable is whether the test expects to run across a collection and
gather net results, or against a single class. Also 'run once.' My 
version mingles runner & fixture. This will get further refactored as
more test variants are added.

Scouts is feature complete, and the obvious bugs have been handled. There's
still some refactoring opportunities and more subtle issues listed in TO_DO, 
but now's a good time to run a test pass and see where things stand.

In addition to the above three criteria, all automated tests need to pass. 
And if anything new is uncovered, we should ideally add another automated 
test for the future (and to TDD our way to a fix).

Rules	Scheme		Mode	Pass/Fail
------------------------------------------
CT77	Default		New	PASS
CT77	Default		Load	PASS
CT77	Print-friendly	New	PASS
CT77	Print-friendly	Load	PASS

CT81	Default		New	PASS
CT81	Default		Load	PASS
CT81	Print-friendly	New	PASS
CT81	Print-friendly	Load	PASS

Scouts	Default		New	PASS
Scouts	Default		Load	PASS
Scouts	Print-friendly	New	PASS
Scouts	Print-friendly	Load	PASS

Only nagging issue so far is extra output during ScoutsEx (both New + Load), 
and some stray debugging spew coming from System.toString().

Another: I thought I added an Amber Zone condition for "no fuel available"
(i.e. no water and no Gas Giants in-system). Spotted at least one violation,
need to check the logic. (Subsector_Shu 0703)
