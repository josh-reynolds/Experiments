Testing Traveller app

Need more automated tests, and probably a more robust framework. Currently
have a very simple hand-rolled test class with just three tests in it.

Uncertain what will play nice with Processing. Needs exploration; but also
consider migrating the whole thing to plain Java (in which case we'd need 
to re-implement all the graphics stuff and other library support). But we 
then take advantage of JUnit, Cucumber, etc. as well as get away from the
limitations of the hidden inner classes.

We can do manual spot-checking for now (sketch below), but given the volume
of output this will probably only catch egregious errors.

Most basic - runs without exceptions.
Second level - screen/console output passes visual inspection
Third level - data files (3) written to disk pass inspection

In addition to automated tests, could write some parser/scanners that 
do the equivalent separate from the app itself.

Scenarios:
Two modes times two schemes times three rulesets = 12 scenarios
