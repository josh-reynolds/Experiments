Merging data structures for child orbits - this
implies changes to the algorithm. The original version 
(used in Star) is constrained and shaped by the 
underlying array.

Star uses an array of orbits: Orbit[] orbits
Orbit uses a TreeMap of orbits: TreeMap<Integer,Orbit> moons

In all cases, we want an ordered list by orbit number,
hence the chosen data structures. In the case of Star,
array was simple, and the algorithm produces lists of numbers
before filling them, so this made sense. Additionally, for
Stars, any empty/unassigned slots are intentionally flagged.

For Orbit, however, values are assigned while creating each
satellite so we don't know in advance how many slots to create.
And there's no concern about empties.

For traversal across the entire tree, it's much simpler to
have a single structure and uniformity (as outlined in the 
Composite pattern). It will be easier to shift the Star approach 
over than the reverse, and TreeMaps are overall simpler to work 
with. 

A couple other bonuses:

 * We have the tricky issue of Captured Planets to deal with, 
   which have fractional orbit values and are difficult to do 
   when orbits are implicitly integer values derived from the 
   array indices.

 * Star.createSatellites is called by an external entity (System)
   rather than from within the ctor. IIRC there was a chicken+egg
   issue forcing this design - hoping the revised algorithm doesn't
   suffer from this and we can hide everything behind the ctor.

There are at least a couple special cases, too:

 * The primary star is root of the tree, and has null values
   for some fields and a 'magic number' orbit (see super ctor 
   args below).

 * There is potentially one 'close companion' which doesn't have
   an orbit number or any possibility of its own child satellites.

Unsnarling the algorithm below. (Leaving out extraneous details 
like UWP).

Algorithm in Star -----------------------------

  System_ScoutsEx.ctor(coordinate)                       // stored in Subsector
    Star.ctor(isPrimary=true, system)                    // stored in System
      Orbit.ctor(barycenter=null, orbit#=-1, zone=null)  // initializes Orbit.moons
      Star.retrieveOrbitalZones()
    Star.createSatellites()
      Star.generateCompanionCount()                      // only active on primary + far companions
                                                         // create temp companion list
      [:for each companion:]
        Star.ctor(isPrimary=false, system)               // stored in temp companion list
      Star.generateCompanionOrbits(listCompanion)        // should be in loop?
      Star.calculateMaxOrbits()
      Star.createOrbits(count, maxCompanion)             // sizes/creates Star.orbits[]
      Star.placeCompanions(count, maxCompanion, listCompanion)
      Star.placeNullOrbits()
        Null.ctor(this, orbit#, zone)                    // stored in Star.orbits[]
      Star.placeEmptyOrbits(count, maxCompanion)
        Star.getRandomNullOrbit()
        Empty.ctor(this, orbit#, zone)                   // stored in Star.orbits[]
      Star.placeForbiddenOrbits()
        Forbidden.ctor(this, orbit#, zone)               // stored in Star.orbits[]
      Star.placeCapturedPlanets()                        // still just a stub
      Star.placeGasGiants()
        Star.availableOrbitsForGiants()
        GasGiant.ctor(this, orbit#, zone)                // stored in Star.orbits[]
      Star.placePlanetoidBelts()
        Star.availableOrbitsForPlanetoids()
        Planetoid.ctor(this, orbit#, zone)               // stored in Star.orbits[]
      Star.placePlanets()
        Planet.ctor(this, orbit#, zone)                  // stored in Star.orbits[]
      [:for each companion:]
        Star.createSatellites()

Algorithm in Orbit ----------------------------

  GasGiant/Planet.ctor(barycenter, orbit#, zone)         // stored in parent Star.orbits[]
    Orbit.ctor(barycenter, orbit#, zone)                 // initializes Orbit.moons
    GasGiant/Planet.generateSatelliteCount()
    Orbit.createSatellites(count)
      [:for each count:]
        GasGiant/Planet.generateSatelliteSize()
        Orbit.generateSatelliteOrbit(counter, isRing)
          Orbit.prune(list)
            Orbit.isTaken(orbit)
        Moon/Ring.ctor(barycenter, orbit#, zone)         // stored in Orbit.moons

===============================================
OBSERVATIONS

Possible bug - moons/ring pass their parent planet orbit number
to the super ctor. Probably does not agree with their 'true' value
as stored in the TreeMap key. Investigate.

Also - check whether we really need these references to barycenter and
orbit # in the child object. Could this all be part of the collection
management in the parent component? Query methods on the child could
interrogate the parent instead.

Star ctor is inconsistent w/ the rest, probably because we started out
with the special case primary. Rest of orbit hierarchy takes an orbit
number and that guides the order of operations in calling their ctor.

Leftover from eliminating the previous/separate companions list - we
create a temp list to hold them, _then_ we generate orbits and push them
into the orbits array. Ties with the previous note. Seems like everything
that takes the temp list as an arg should be _inside_ the loop instead.

Once we clean up the ordering and unify, probably opportunity to simplify 
a lot of the special case logic via appropriate subclassing and polymorphism.
For example, should Primary and Companion be subclasses of Star?

Refactoring in progress - structure documented above has already changed, but 
leaving these notes as-is for now. First target is the temporary companions list
and pulling all related operations into the loop. Then we probably pivot towards
moving method calls prior to the createOrbits() call (which initializes the array).
If they run w/o null pointer exception, they are clear. As this progresses, we
start populating the array from the TreeMap and not the reverse - and finally,
we can remove it altogether.

5/9/23

First portions are done -  the temp array has been eliminated, and all method 
calls in Star.createSatellite() are prior to initialization of the Orbit[] 
array. We should be able to track down remaining references next, and eliminate
it - then obts merges with the TreeMap in the superclass (currently Orbit.moons).

And done! We now have a single data structure coming from the superclass, used
for both moons and planets (and all the variants). Lots of additional cleanup
and refactoring to do, and some potential bugs to investigate.

5/10/23

Compare ctors for all members of Orbit hierarchy. There's some inconsistency,
which may be OK, as well as some odd looking calls to super and magic numbers.
(Later we'll extend this comparison to the entire interface...)

Orbit     (Orbit _barycenter, int _orbit, String _zone)

Empty     (Star _barycenter,  int _orbit, String _zone)
  super(_barycenter, _orbit, _zone);

Forbidden (Star _barycenter,  int _orbit, String _zone)
  super(_barycenter, _orbit, _zone);

Null      (Star _barycenter,  int _orbit, String _zone)
  super(_barycenter, _orbit, _zone);

GasGiant  (Star _barycenter,  int _orbit, String _zone)
  super(_barycenter, _orbit, _zone);

Planet    (Orbit _barycenter, int _orbit, String _zone)
  super(_barycenter, _orbit, _zone);

Planetoid (Orbit _barycenter, int _orbit, String _zone)
  super(_barycenter, _orbit, _zone);

Moon      (Orbit _planet,                 String _zone, int _size)
  super(_planet, _planet.orbitNumber, _zone);

Ring      (Orbit _planet,                 String _zone)
  super(_planet.barycenter, _planet.orbitNumber, _zone);

Star      (Boolean _primary, System _parent)
  super(null, -1, (String)null);

Likely artifacts of putting this together over many days, as well as 
following along with the RAW procedure as closely as I could. Some of
this may still be OK, but we should reconcile & rationalize now.

Star is the biggest outlier in terms of how it's handled. Then
second-level satellites (Moons/Rings).

Top level container     : primary Star
Can contain             ~ 
   2nd level leafs      : Empty
                          Forbidden
                          Null
                          Planetoid

   2nd level containers : companion Star
               
   2nd level containers : GasGiant
                          Planet
   Can contain          ~
      3rd level leafs   : Moon
                          Ring

This isn't a 'pure' Composite where we can group and nest components ad hoc.
There are rules for which goes where, and a depth limit. Structure can be
enforced and communicated through the parent back-reference, at least for the
second-level entities, all of which orbit a Star only.

Done - all ctors (except Star) have uniform calling convention, with just a 
single special case with Moon:

subclass (Orbit _barycenter, int _orbit, String _zone)
  super(_barycenter, _orbit, _zone)



Third-level is trickier - the only common class is the superclass.

Tested the waters by first changing Planet/Planetoid's first argument to
Star. This causes downstream problems in Moon/Ring first from the super-ctor
calls, then later queries against Star that fail with null references. Backing 
this out for now.

Another approach might be to handle everything via Orbit (kind of the point 
of Composite anyway). As needed, we could downcast - and any such instances 
would be candidates for factoring into polymorphic method calls. GasGiant 
most likely to cause problems - try that first. Worked trivially! Do the rest.
